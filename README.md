# Alzheimers_Disease_Prediction
  + Alzheimer's Disease or AD is a neurological brain disorder that destroys memory and mental functions. It is one of the most common causes of dementia and is usually found in older patients. It is a progressive disease affecting millions worldwide and very few people who are suffering from AD are diagnosed correctly and in a timely manner. Hence, early and accurate prediction of AD is largely beneficial in battling dementia and delaying symptoms of the disease.
  + This study aims to accurately predict Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the early stages by making use of machine learning techniques.
  + Specifically, we will be using the following ML models to classify test subjects into demented or nondemented groups-
    + Tree Based Classifiers: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, & XGBoost Classifiers as well as
    + Non-Tree Based Classifiers: SVM, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Neural Network, & Voting Classifiers
  + We will compare the performance of these models based on their Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC, F1 Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
  + The dataset used is the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset, in which the Soft Voting Classifier gave the best results having an accuracy of 0.947, AUC score of 0.953 and MCC of 0.898
